# Solver design

## Packages
- NetworkX

## requirements
- Two operation modes
  - Solve (compute whole solution)
  - Step (step through the solution - for visualisation purposes)

### Step mode
either:
- step through the algorithm
- solve algorithm and keep a log of each step

## parameters
- cost function
-
