Future on our algorithm could involve research into genetic operators or subroutines to seed the genetic population to produce better starting points for the local search. Our code has been designed, documented and tested, such that another group can expand on our work. An open question would be to evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a large number of colours/demographic groups. 

We believe our web tool serves as a good introduction to $k$-center problems and with further work it has the potential to be an educational aid for more complex algorithms discussed in the paper.
