\paragraph{Analysis of solution cost}~\\
Our result for the Wilcoxon test (\Cref{method:wilcoxon_test}) was \num{1.819e-12}, proving our observations to be statistically significant. From analysis using \Cref{method:counting_results}, colourful PBS produced lower costs than the \emph{Ban} algorithm for all 40 instances. The mean cost was 43.2\% lower on average.

To account for variance we conduct analysis using \Cref{method:counting_results_variance}. Using $\Delta =2$, which accounts for 95\% of the distribution, colorful \acrshort{pbs} outperforms \emph{Ban} for all 40 Gowalla problems. Furthermore if we take $\Delta =3$, which accounts for 99.7\% of the distribution, our algorithm still has lower costs for 39/40 problem instances.

\paragraph{Further analysis}~\\
We ran the brute force algorithm (\cref{alg:brute_force_colourful_k_center}) to obtain an optimal solution of a smaller 55 node problem instance (this took 5 hours and 16 minutes).

Over 50 trials, colourful PBS converges to the optimal cost without fail whereas the \emph{Ban} algorithm achieves a cost 80\% above the optimal.

    \label{fig:memory_usage}
\end{figure}

Analysing memory usage (\cref{fig:memory_usage}), colourful PBS uses 1.7\% more memory than \emph{Ban}, however this is insignificant compared to the memory required to store the graph which is around ~70\% of memory usage for both algorithms .

Overall for the real word 3D Gowalla data set Colourful PBS produces better results than the \emph{Ban} algorithm even after accounting for variance, however on average it incurs a five-fold increase in runtime.
