\paragraph{Analysis of solution cost}~\\
We report statistically significant results for the synthetic data set, with a p-value of \num{1.819e-12} for the Wilcoxon test (\Cref{method:wilcoxon_test}). Colourful PBS achieves a lower cost than the \emph{Ban} algorithm for 39/40 Synthetic instances (\Cref{method:counting_results}). 

If we conduct variance analysis using \Cref{method:counting_results_variance} with $\Delta =2$, our algorithm outperforms the \emph{Ban} algorithm for 34/40 problem instances. Furthermore if we extend this to account for $99.7\%$ of the population ($\Delta =3$),  colourful PBS still achieves a lower cost in 31/40 instances.

The average gap between the optimal solution and the \emph{Ban} algorithm was 511.15\%, our algorithm produced solutions significantly closer to the optimal, with an of average 111.32\% above the optimal cost. The average \%-gap for the optimal cost for Colourful PBS was skewed by five instances which were over 600\% above the optimal cost, namely syn26, syn27, syn31, syn34 and syn35. In terms of achieving the optimal cost, Colourful PBS returned the optimal solution for 22/40 synthetic problems (with 100\% accuracy over 50 repeats), while \emph{Ban} achieved the optimal cost for 0/40.
