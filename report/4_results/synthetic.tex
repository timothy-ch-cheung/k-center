\paragraph{Analysis of solution cost}~\\
We report statistically significant results for the synthetic data set, with a p-value of \num{1.819e-12} for the Wilcoxon test. Colourful PBS achieves a lower cost than the O(1)-approximation for 39/40 Gowalla instances. The average gap between the optimal solution and the $O(1)$-approximation was 511.15\%, our algorithm produced solutions significantly closer to the optimal, with an of average 111.32\% above the optimal cost. The average \%-gap for the optimal cost for Colourful PBS was skewed by five instances which were over 600\% above the optimal cost, namely syn26, syn27, syn31, syn34 and syn35. In terms of achieving the optimal cost, Colourful PBS return the optimal solution for 22/40 synthetic problems (with 100\% accuracy over 50 repeats), while the $O(1)$-approximation achieved the optimal cost for none of the problems.

If we conduct the same analysis to account for memetic algorithm variablility in \cref{section:colourful_k_center_gowalla}, our algorithm outperforms the $O(1)$-approximation for 34/40 instances for $2\sigma$ above $\mu$ and 31/40 for $3\sigma$ above $\mu$. Clearly even accounting for variability, our algorithm produces solutions with lower costs for over 75\% of synthetic problem instances.
