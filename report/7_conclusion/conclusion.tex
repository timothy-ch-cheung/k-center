This project studies the $k$-center and colourful $k$-center problems; the former is a classical NP-hard problem and the latter is an extension to the $k$-center relevant to fair machine learning. We evaluated algorithms from approximation, genetic and randomised algorithm paradigms for solving the $k$-center, then used these findings to propose a new \gls{memetic_algs} algorithm for the colourful $k$-center, named colourful PBS. We showed colourful PBS produced solutions with lower costs than the existing pseudo 2-approximation algorithm. However we note that the increase in performance is at the expense of run time. In addition, we create a web tool to visualise solutions with the aim to educate a user about $k$-center problems and their related algorithms.
