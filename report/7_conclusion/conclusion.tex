The $k$-center problem is a classical NP-hard problem, which has potential to be applied to facility location problems. Recently, it has seen relevance in fair machine learning, leading to the introduction of the colourful $k$-center. This paper evaluated algorithms from approximation, genetic and randomized algorithm paradigms to solve these problems. We proposed local search heuristic for the colourful $k$-center which, through empirical experiments, proved to improve on existing methods. In addition we create a web tool which visualises solutions and aims to educate a user about each algorithm step by step.
