We started this project with a knowledge in Python, JavaScript and web programming in React. This project has allowed us to learn new languages, through the use of TypeScript for our web tool and R for our statistical analysis. We have also gained knowledge in new libraries such as Pyomo (Linear programming), D3.js (graphing) and Flask (web framework). We have also been exposed to modern technologies, from using Cypress for our regression tests and Docker for deploying our application.

From an academic viewpoint, we started the project with zero knowledge in linear programming, approximation algorithms and genetic algorithms. We believe we have built strong foundations in those topics through conducting our study. In particular we believe our new knowledge about linear programs will allow us to access a wider range of academic papers and optimisation problems in general.
