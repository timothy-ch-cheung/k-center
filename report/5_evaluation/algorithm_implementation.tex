Through our statistical analysis in \cref{section:colourful_k_center_gowalla} and \cref{section:colourful_k_center_synthetic} our algorithm proved to be conclusively better than the \emph{Ban} algorithm. Across 4000 trials over 80 problem instances (Gowalla and Synthetic), Colourful PBS produces solutions with a 48.6\% lower cost than the algorithm by \citeauthor{bandyapadhyay_constant_2019}, at the expense of a 3.3-fold increase in runtime. This increase in runtime is partly due to running the \emph{Ban} algorithm as a subroutine to seed the population. Given more time, we would explore alternative population generation methods to allow for quicker convergence.

Furthermore if we were to extend the scope of our project, we would have also liked to implement two recent algorithms for the Colourful $k$-center by \textcite{jia_fair_2020} and \textcite{anegg_technique_2020}. Gaining empirical results for these theoretical algorithms would allow us to make stronger conclusions on the performance of Colourful PBS.
