To ensure our code works correctly we wrote unit tests in pytest for the server code. Our tests cover functionality of each algorithm on small instances ($n\leq 25$) and the subroutines they use such as the PBS local search. In total, we have 180 tests covering 96\% lines of code. 

We chose to not write unit tests for the front end as they are tedious to maintain which would slow down our development. Instead we wrote end to end tests, which covers the all website pages using Cypress. The end to end tests go through each page and take a screenshot then compare it with a saved snapshot. If the screenshot is not the same as the saved snapshot, we manually inspect to ensure the visual change is as expected. We believe this set of screenshot regression tests ensured our core functionality did not regress between major changes to our website. If we were to target our application for a production environment, we would write a suite of unit tests to cover edge cases for the UI.

We also used tools monitor the health of our app during development. For every pull request we used set up a Github actions pipeline to automatically run the tests and produce a CodeCov report, with quality checks failing if our code coverage was below the coverage of the main branch. Continuous integration was important for our workflow as it ensured any code going into the main branch as both passing tests and sufficiently tested.
