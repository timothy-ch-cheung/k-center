When developing our application, we used GitHub issues to keep track of our bugs and to prioritise the features. We also used releases within a repository to make a release cut when a new feature was completed.

To keep our application reliable, we used pytest to write unit tests. Using GitHub actions, we automatically run the test suite for each remote push. Before merging a branch into master, we performed a code review to ensure obvious bugs were caught.
