    text={approximation},
    description={algorithms that produces a solution with a provable guarantee to be within a certain distance to the optimal solution. The guarantee is expressed as a multiplicative factor, for example a $n$-approximation algorithm will always return a solution equal to or less than $n$ times the cost of the optimal solution. Another common notation used is a $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation, which does not define a specific approximation factor but states that the approximation factor does not grow with the size of the input}
