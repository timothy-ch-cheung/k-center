\textcite{feo_greedy_1995} introduced an algorithm framework GRASP (Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedures), which has been widely cited in combinatorial optimization literature. The main idea of GRASP is to perform three steps iteratively until some stopping criterion is met; first construct a randomised solution, optimise it using local search, and update the solution if it is better than the best so far.

\textcite{mladenovic_solving_2003} introduced the concept of a \emph{critical vertex}; a vertex $v$ is a \emph{critical vertex} if and only if $d(v, min_{c\in C}d(v, c))=Cost(C)$, that is $v$ is a point which defines the cost of the solution $C$. \textcite{battiti_new_2017} extended this concept by counting the number of \emph{critical vertices} in a solution. They created a construction algorithm (Greedy Randomised Build \cref{alg:greedy_construction}) and a local search algorithm (Plateau Surfer \cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search}), to be embedded in the \acrshort{grasp} framework.



There are two phases to to Greedy Randomised build. The first phase selects a $\alpha\cdot k$ initial centers (\cref{alg:greedy_construction} lines 2-7). A lower $\alpha$ causes fewer centers to be selected randomly. The second phase selects the remaining centers by iteratively generating a Restricted Candidate List (RCL) and selecting a new center from it (\cref{alg:greedy_construction} lines 8-23). The candidates for a RCL is parameterised by $\beta$, a lower $\beta$ results in a smaller and greedier RCL. The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(nk)$, since the worst case is when we have to build $k$ RCLs. 

While \acrshort{pbs} generates initial solutions purely greedily, Greedy Randomised build generates them pseudo greedily with the greediness parameterised by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. \textcite{battiti_new_2017} did not report the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ they used to produce their results, we conducted experiments and determined that $\alpha =0.5$ and $\beta =0.25$ were suitable (our methodology is described in \cref{appendix:grasp_param}).

To understand how the Plateau Surfer local search works, we explicitly define the function count\_cv (\cref{alg:count_cv}). The function count\_cv counts the number of \emph{critical vertices} of a given solution $C$ with cost $r$. A naive implemention of count\_cv would have $\mathcal{O}(kn)$ time complexity, but we can use the neighbourhood structures defined by \textcite{mladenovic_solving_2003} we can reduce the time complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (detailed in \cref{section:pbs}).

Plateau Surfer local search checks all swaps between centers and vertices, it will perform the swap if it reduces the solution cost (\cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} lines 11-13, 19-21). They recognise this strategy may reach a local minima; in that situation, a swap which results in an equal cost but a lower number of \emph{critical vertices} is made (\cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} lines 14-16, 22-24). We correct a typo from the original paper in \cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} line 8, which initialised best\_cv with $\bar{C}$ instead of $C$). The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(kn^2)$.

The total time complexity of \acrshort{grasp_ps} is $\mathcal{O}(kn^2)$, bounded by a constant number of \acrshort{grasp} iterations. The key finding that \textcite{battiti_new_2017} made given a solution with two equal costs, the one with fewer \emph{critical vertices} is better. In their analysis, they reported better results than VNS (embedded in GRASP). However, we believe \textcite{battiti_new_2017} made an error in implementing the VNS algorithm; there are two reasons for this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The VNS paper stated VNS should "always move to a
solution of equal value" but \citeauthor{battiti_new_2017} contradicts this, stating "as soon as a plateau is met, Mladenovi\'{c}â€™s local search ends"
    \item The VNS results reported by \citeauthor{battiti_new_2017} shows poorer performance than the original VNS results
\end{enumerate}

We contacted \citeauthor{battiti_new_2017} via email to verify this, but we did not receive a reply. Nevertheless their contribution remains valuable as it defines a systematic method for searching solutions of equal cost.
