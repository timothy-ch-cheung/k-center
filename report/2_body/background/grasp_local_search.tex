\textcite{feo_greedy_1995} introduced an algorithm framework GRASP (Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedures), which has been widely cited in \gls{combinatorial_optimisation} literature. The main idea of GRASP is to perform three steps iteratively until some stopping criterion is met; first construct a randomised solution, optimise it using local search, and update the solution if it is better than the best so far.

\textcite{mladenovic_solving_2003} introduced the concept of a \emph{critical vertex}; a vertex $v$ is a \emph{critical vertex} if and only if $d(v, min_{c\in C}d(v, c))=Cost(C)$, that is $v$ is a point which defines the cost of the solution $C$. \textcite{battiti_new_2017} extended this concept by counting the number of \emph{critical vertices} in a solution. They created a solution construction algorithm (Greedy Randomised Build \cref{alg:greedy_construction}) and a local search algorithm (Plateau Surfer \cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search}), to be embedded in the \acrshort{grasp} framework.

Greedy Randomised Build has two phases and two parameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). The first phase selects a $\alpha\cdot k$ initial centers (\cref{alg:greedy_construction} lines 2-7). A lower $\alpha$ causes fewer centers to be selected randomly. The second phase selects the remaining centers by iteratively generating a Restricted Candidate List (RCL) and selecting a new center from it (\cref{alg:greedy_construction} lines 8-23). The candidates for a RCL is parameterised by $\beta$, a lower $\beta$ results in a smaller and greedier RCL. The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(nk)$, since the worst case is when we have to build $k$ RCLs. 

While \acrshort{pbs} generates initial solutions purely greedily, Greedy Randomised Build generates parameterises greediness using $\alpha$ and $\beta$. \textcite{battiti_new_2017} did not report the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ they used to produce their results, we conducted experiments and determined that $\alpha =0.5$ and $\beta =0.25$ were suitable (our methodology is described in \cref{appendix:grasp_param}).

To understand how the Plateau Surfer local search works, we explicitly define the function count\_cv (\cref{alg:count_cv}). The function count\_cv counts the number of \emph{critical vertices} of a given solution $C$ with cost $r$. A naive implemention of count\_cv would have $\mathcal{O}(kn)$ time complexity, but using the VNS data structures (detailed in \cref{section:pbs}) we can reduce the time complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ .

Plateau Surfer local search checks all swaps between centers and vertices, it will perform the swap that reduces the solution cost the most (\cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} lines 11-13, 19-21). They recognise this strategy may reach local minima; in that situation, a swap which results in an equal cost but a lower number of \emph{critical vertices} is made (\cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} lines 14-16, 22-24). We correct a typo from the original paper in \cref{alg:plateau_surfer_local_search} line 8, which initialised best\_cv with $\bar{C}$ instead of $C$). The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(kn^2)$.

The total time complexity of \acrshort{grasp_ps} is $\mathcal{O}(kn^2)$, bounded by a constant number of \acrshort{grasp} iterations. The key finding that \textcite{battiti_new_2017} made was, given a solution with two equal costs, the one with fewer \emph{critical vertices} is better. In their analysis, they reported better results than VNS embedded in GRASP. However, we believe \textcite{battiti_new_2017} made an error in implementing the VNS algorithm; there are two reasons for this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They state "as soon as a plateau is met, Mladenovi\'{c}â€™s local search ends" (\cite{battiti_new_2017}) but this contradicts the original paper which states VNS will "always move to a solution of equal value" (\cite{mladenovic_solving_2003})
    \item The VNS results reported by \citeauthor{battiti_new_2017} shows poorer performance than the original VNS results
\end{enumerate}

We contacted \citeauthor{battiti_new_2017} via email to verify this, but we did not receive a reply. Nevertheless their contribution remains valuable as it defines a systematic method for searching solutions of equal cost.
