A na\"ive brute force method would be to enumerate all candidate solutions, calculate the cost for each candidate and return the solution with the minimum cost. In the worst case this would take $\mathcal{O}(\binom{n}{k}\cdot n\cdot k)$, the algorithm is detailed in \cref{brute-force-k-center} for the readers' convenience. Clearly brute force methods are unfeasible for realistic use cases due to combinatorial explosion even at low values of $n$. 

If requirement of an optimal solution is relaxed, various algorithmic paradigms can be applied to create algorithms that run in polynomial time. In the following sections we will describe approximation, genetic, and randomised algorithms that solve the $k$-center problem.
