Following the accessibility requirement, we also consider the ease of setup. As we use linear program solvers, this is an extra dependency that is not installable the dependency manager Python pip. Therefore we use Docker, we configure the build file to create and package the static web files, install all dependencies; a user can clone our git repository, execute 'docker build' and 'docker run', then have a working instance of our application. This also allows us to easily deploy to cloud platforms such as Heroku.
