Our primary aim is to evaluate algorithms which solve the $k$-center problems. From implementing these algorithms, we adapt the techniques to propose an algorithm to solve colourful $k$-center problem which produces better results than the $O(1)$-approximation algorithm. 

Furthermore, from our literature review we noticed both theoretical papers and papers that presented empirical evidence lacked publicly available implementations of algorithms described. Therefore, as a secondary objective, we were motivated to provide clarity on how these algorithms work in action. To do this we aim to develop a web application which has two aims: The first is to produce visualisations for the algorithms on different data sets. The second is to break down each algorithm to show the solution in intermediate steps, with objective of improving understanding on how it arrives to the solution.
