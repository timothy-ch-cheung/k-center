Our primary aim is to evaluate algorithms which solve $k$-center problems. From implementing these algorithms, we adapt the techniques to propose an algorithm to solve colourful $k$-center problem which produces better results than the $O(1)$-approximation algorithm. 

Furthermore, from our literature review we noticed both theoretical papers and papers that presented empirical evidence lacked publicly available implementations of algorithms described. Therefore, as a secondary objective, we were motivated to provide clarity on how these algorithms work. To do this we aim to develop a web application which has two aims: The first is to produce visualisations of solutions on different data sets. The second is visualise algorithms step by step, to show how each algorithm works.
