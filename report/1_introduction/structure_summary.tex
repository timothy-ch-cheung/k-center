The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section is a review of the literature on the $k$-center problem and its variants and descriptions the algorithms at a high level. \Cref{section:background} is a detailed description of the algorithms which we have implemented. In \cref{section:design} we describe the design of our tool to to visualise these algorithms. \Cref{section:results} evaluates the performance of the algorithm using empirical methods; in particular, we investigate the running time and analyse the distance between the solution cost to the optimal cost. Finally in \cref{section:evaluation}, we provide evaluation of our algorithm and tool, then discuss potential extensions in \cref{section:discussion}.
