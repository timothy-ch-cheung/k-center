In this literature review we will cover the history of the $k$-center problem, first introduced by \textcite{hakimi_optimum_1964} and the subsequent variants introduced by \textcite{charikar_algorithms_2001} and \textcite{bandyapadhyay_constant_2019}. We give formal definitions for the $k$-center, Robust $k$-center and Colourful $k$-center problems provide real world analogies to contextualise them. Following this, we show some novel applications of the $k$-center problem and then describe traditional and modern approaches to solving the $k$-center and Colourful $k$-center problems.
