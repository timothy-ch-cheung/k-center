In this literature review we will cover the history of the $k$-center problem, and the subsequent constrained variants. We give formal definitions for the $k$-center, robust $k$-center and colourful $k$-center problems provide real world analogies to contextualise them. Following this, we describe novel applications and then review traditional and modern approaches to solving the $k$-center and Colourful $k$-center problems. For those unfamiliar with the domain specific terminology, we provide a glossary in \cref{main}.
