# Semester 2 Week 7 Log
Lots of progress word count wise, but not many sections being completed - probably sections were more detailed than I thought. Dissertation current word count: 5889.

## Spillover work from last week

# Planned work for this week
continue with spillover (hopefully complete it)

# Presentation notes
## Motivations
- Applicable to facility location, real world application
- Fairness in machine learning is becoming more popular
- Out of X papers I've read on the k-center problem only 1 had publically available source code, therefore we implement algorithms and create visualisation tools

## Implemented algorithms k-center
- Gon algorithm 2-approximation (Gonzalez)
- PBS memetic algorithm (Pullan)
- GRASP Plateau Surfer (Ferone et. al)

## Implemented algorithms Colourful k-center
- O(1)-apporixmation (Gonzalez)
- Colourful PBS (our own)

## Important decisions made
- Docker easy to deploy (important since Linear program solvers aren't pre installed)
- D3 visualisations
