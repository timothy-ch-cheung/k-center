## Difficulties
- Choosing the correct level to explain the problems from the introduction - e.g. are "approximation algorithms"/"memetic algorithms" the right level the address the introduction or should they be left for a later section
- Work from other modules for preparing for assessent week slowed down FYP work for this week
