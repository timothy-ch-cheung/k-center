# Semester 2 Week 2 Log

## Progress of planned work
| Task                                                               | Progress              | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | 
| introduce Colourful K-Center and how it builds on original K-Center| partial               |
| Aims and motiviation section                                       | not started           |
| Implement detailed step by step visualisation genetic algortihms   | in progress           |

## Difficulties
- To get step by step visualisation for  genetic algorithms requires quite a bit of refactoring
- Paper writing taking longer than expected
  
## Extra unplanned work completed
- Found a paper "A New Local Search for the p-Center Problem Based on the Critical Vertex Concept", thought it would help fix the convergence issues in PBS. Implemented algorithm but could also not reproduce results reported in the paper. Emailed author but have not yet recieved a response.
