# Week 9
Summary: Didn't make as much progress as usual this week as I was working on the ML assignment (worth 25% of the module) and Security assignment (worth 12.5% of the module). This week: background reading for the alpha-seperated special case, preparing presentation for inspection, starting to implement genetic algorithm.

# Background Reading
- Read papers about exact perfect matchings and pfaffians
- I think I understand how the Colourful K-Center problem is geometrically reduced (using voronoi regions and minkoski sums) to the exact perfect matching problem
- But don't understand how the exact perfect matching problem is solved - algorithm by  et al. in "Random Pseudo-Polynomial Algorithms for Exact Matroid Problems" uses Pfaffians and Wedge products which I don't understand even after reading up about them

# Presentation
- Did initial draft presentation to Rajesh, was too long at 15 minutes. Got useful feedback on how to make it more clear and concise.
- Re wrote the presentation and recorded it [8 minutes]

# Developing Genetic algorithm
- Made a start on this, it has five parts: local search, mutation 1, mutation 2, crossover 1, crossover 2.
- I am currently midway through local search

# Plans this week
- Complete implementation of genetic algorithm
