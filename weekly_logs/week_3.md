A Constant Approximation for Colorful k-center: 

Fair colourful K-Center - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04059.pdf

A Constant Approximation for Colorful k-center - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08906.pdf

Didn't understand the proofs of approximation but will re-read them to understand them.

 
## Background reading on Linear Programming
Did some background reading on Linear programming to understand the Algorithms presented in both papers - 

### Sci-py
had a look at an article about scipy linprog function - https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-programming-with-python-db7742b91cb

Seemed quite limited in the way constraints were represented.

### Pyomo
Looked at pyomo in solving the p-median and travelling salesman problem to get an understanding of how the LP algorithms translated to code:

After re-reading the algorithm from "Fair colourful K-Center" many times, I implemented it using pyomo and it seemed to produce the correct result. 

## This/next week:

I will read:

- A Memetic Genetic Algorithm for the Vertex p-center Problem - https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/evco.2008.16.3.417 
  

 and two papers suggested by Rajesh:
