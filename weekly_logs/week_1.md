# Week 1 Log

Had an initial group FYP meeting with Rajesh, out of his project list I am interested in the K-Center problem and Streaming algorithms.

Did some preliminary reading to get an idea of which one I am more interested in:

## K-Center

Overview of the problem - https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2017/cmsc451-0101/Lects/lect08-greedy-k-center.pdf 

Interested in whether genetic solutions could be applied to this problem, so I did some reading about how genetic algorithms worked:
