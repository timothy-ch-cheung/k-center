# Semester 2 Easter + Week 9 Log

## Easter
- tested different genetic architectures for colourful PBS
- Completed colourful PBS algorithm
- Made presentation for demo
- made initial draft of 10876 words

## Week 9
- Did demo, main feedback was justifying the conclusions made through data collected
- cut down draft to 9990 words

Ran benchmarks:
- k-center
  - GRASP-PS, PBS, Gon on ORLIB data set of 
- colourful k-center
  - pseudo 2-approximation, colourful PBS on GOWALLA data set
  - pseudo 2-approximation, colourful PBS on SYNTHETIC data set

A total of 6000 trials.
