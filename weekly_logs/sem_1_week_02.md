Asked Rajesh for his opinion on my initial idea of comparing traditional and genetic algorithms for solving the non-uniform K-Center problem with some visualisation.

## Background reading
He suggested some reading around the topic which I did:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08628.pdf

The paper introduced me to a new constraint on the k-center problem (the fair k-center). This could possibly be more interesting than the non-uniform k-center as its a problem that has had a couple of papers written on it recently (2019-2020). 

## Streaming K centers
Also he suggested reading about streaming k-centers:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06263

Found the first paper to be somewhat accessible (I could understand the general idea of the algorithm but not the proof for its approximation factor)

Found the second paper to be completely inaccessible - couldn't understand much of it.

 

## This/next week:

Read "Fair colourful K-center"

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04059.pdf

Read papers about K-center with outliers.

Decide on project proposal.
